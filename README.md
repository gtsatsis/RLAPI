# RLAPI

RLAPI is the new RATELIMITED file hosting API, allowing for file uploading & handling in a fast and lightweight manner.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
PHP 7.x
Apache/NGINX/A PHP Capable Webserver
Minio (Can be found on minio.io)
Postgres
Our sample Database File (Will be uploaded later on. Currently working on polishing our software :) )

Also, you'll need a brain!
```

### Installing

Once you have installed all the prerequisites, clone this git repo to your working directory.

Import the database file into PostgreSQL and make sure to edit your token.

Currently, there is no configuration and everything is hardcoded, as such, please edit the files and the requirements accordingly with the file locations that you are going to have.

Once done, POST to the api with a file in the form files\[\].

Note: Do not forget to change your token in the database!

## Running the tests

Testing is fairly simple, just POST to the API and voila!
